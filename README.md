#

The `@badging-bot,` is a GitHub App that helps to coordinate the workflow of the [D&I Badging](https://handbook.chaoss.community/community-handbook/badging/overview), a peer-review program that is managed by the [CHAOSS Community](https://handbook.chaoss.community/community-handbook/). The main function of the badging-bot is to improve the efficiency of the review process of badging applications with some automated integration.

The badging-bot is built around the Journal of Open Source Software [peer review system](https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and is used to facilitate the application process for earning DEI event badges.

## setting up local development environment

Setting up the bot is as easy as navigating to your project folder in the terminal and running;

```sh
source <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/badging/bot-scripts/main/install.sh)
```

### Functions

The badging-bot is specifically intended to:

- Notify maintainers about new applications
- Guide applicants/reviewers in the review process
- Assign reviewers for a submission
- Open checklists for reviewers according to the type of event
- Check current badge status
- Generate the final badge link
- Close an application issue when an application is finalized
- Update events table with reviewed events

## Tasks

The badging bot can be used for a specific set of tasks:

- When a new submission is created. Once the issue of a new submission is successfully initiated, `@badging-bot` will do three things:
  - greet the applicant and provide guiding information \([see example](https://github.com/badging/event-diversity-and-inclusion/issues/46#issuecomment-674938374)\)
  - Inform maintainer about new issue via slack using the integration
  - assign reviewers (In progress!)
  - open a checklist for each assigned reviewer \([see example](https://github.com/badging/event-diversity-and-inclusion/issues/46#issuecomment-674938396)\)
- When a command is typed in a review issue comment.
  When someone creates an issue comment with a command, the bot will be triggered and respond in a new comment. This is generally used for generating badges
- When the state of the review changes
  The bot responds to state changes by managing labels and by opening or closing the issue.
